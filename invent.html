                                <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 600px;">
                                    In 2020, Albatros introduced a new autonomous aerial search and rescue system (or
                                    simply a drone) that combines proven systems with new artificial intelligence
                                    technologies.

                                <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 600px;">
                                    The neural network, which is built into the camera and microcomputer of the drone,
                                    recognizes the features and identification marks of the missing person and
                                    automatically transmits the data to the search teams.

                                <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 500px;">
                                    This development helps to search for missing people both high in the mountains and
                                    in the deepest caves, and will help to significantly reduce the search area in a

                                    The first magnetic resonance imaging device was created at the Lebedev Physical
                                    Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2022, and it has become a real
                                    challenge for scientists.

                                    Although you can't take an MRI scan into space, its development was as challenging
                                    as
                                    producing space satellites. There were many different systems that needed to be
                                    developed, and
                                    each one required the involvement of a wide range of specialists, from doctors to
                                    mathematicians and
                                    programmers. </p>

                                <p style=" text-align: left; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 600px;">
                                    The main part of the device, the magnet, is made of Russian-made superconductors,
                                    which has reduced the weight of the device by several tons compared to
                                    previous-generation devices.

                                    In addition, the Russian version is cheaper than its counterparts and is capable of

                                    Previously, robot dogs were only used for entertainment, but now they help people

                                    In 2023, 3Logic Group made a real breakthrough in the construction industry:
                                    the robot dogs scanned the space and helped to obtain 3D models of objects. The
                                    robots were able to conduct a full screening of a construction site in Tyumen in
                                    just 12 minutes. In
                                    comparison: it would take a surveyor up to 72 hours to complete this task.

                                <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 10px;  width: 600px;">
                                    This application of robots in construction improves data accuracy, reduces costs,
                                    and improves the quality of work. In the future, this will become common practice
                                    and can
                                    increase the competitiveness of the industry and help to free surveyors from routine
